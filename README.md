A simple desktop for linux.

How To Instal:

Download SDK, There should be included instructions. The instructions aren't very good with what you need to do. So you open "scripts" and run "install firedeb.sh". The script will do it's work and then you'll have a fully working desktop.

Please make sure your username is "admin" as it won't work if it isn't.
